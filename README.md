# IoT WS8211 LED Stripe Controller
This is a simple OpenSource-Hardware project to control WS2811 LEDs stripes using only a ESP8266 and a Android cellphone or tablet.

The project is just a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the capabilities of the ESP8266 module on it most basic form-factor and with a minimum of external hardware.

## What's on this repository
We tried to include all the basic pieces to build and run this project. This are the project folders an it's contents:

1. *Arduino*: Contains the sketch used with the ESP8266. The sketch sets-up a small web server and also controls the LED stripe.
2. *AppInventor*: Includes the MIT's App Inventor project file that you can use as a template to control the LED stripe from Android.
3. *Fritzing*: This contains a fritzing project to help you to connect all the pieces together.

## Materials (BOM)
To build this project you'll need at least this components:
* ESP8266-01
* Voltage Level Converter
* 3.3V linear Regulator
* 5V@4A voltage source
* WS2811 RGB LED stripe.

To program the ESP8266 you'll also need:
* FTDI USB<->Serial converter working at 3.3V

## How to use it
* Edit the Arduino Sketch and modify the options for wireless access and static IP address to use:

```c++
/* Agrega el nombre y clave de acceso de tu red inalambrica*/
#define SSID "Manda internet al 2020" // Network name (between quotes)
#define PW "nohayinternet" // Password (between quotes)

/* Cambia la configuración IP de tu red local */
#define LOCALIP "192.168.0.226" // String for the local server configuration 
IPAddress ip_addr(192,168,0,126); // Static IP to use
IPAddress gw(192,168,0,1); // Default gateway
IPAddress netmask(255,255,255,0); // Netmask
```
* Upload your Sketch to the ESP8266, this Sketch also requires the Adafruit's NeoPixel library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel (*)
* Connect everything as shown on the Fritzing project file.
* Install the App RemoteRGBTest.apk included on "AppInventor/binaries". If you don't trust me download the "aia" Project for MIT App Inventor and compile the APK from there
* Power everything up and cross your fingers
* If you are still alive and nothing was burn in the process open the App in your cellphone and specify the IP address of the module. To change colors use the sliders and click on "Send color" when ready
* Have fun
